### Welcome to My Cybersecurity Blog

I’m a **Junior Penetration Tester** and an enthusiastic **cybersecurity student**.

I created this blog to document my journey in the cybersecurity field, sharing *writeups* and *walkthroughs* of rooms I’ve completed on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox**.

You’ll also find **study guides**, tips, and insights on various topics related to ethical hacking and penetration testing.
