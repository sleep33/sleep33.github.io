### Welcome to My Cybersecurity Blog

I’m a **Penetration Tester** and a dedicated **cybersecurity enthusiast** constantly on the lookout for the next big vulnerability. This blog is my digital **trophy case**—a place where I document my journey through **CTF challenges** on **TryHackMe**, **Bug Bounty** findings, and my take on real-world **security weaknesses** shaking up the industry.

Expect detailed *writeups* of the rooms I’ve conquered, analysis of the latest **bug bounty** targets I’ve exploited, and insights into the vulnerabilities making headlines. If you're into breaking things (ethically, of course), this blog’s for you.

Join me as I dive into the digital depths, share a laugh (or two), and hopefully make the internet a safer place, one bug at a time.
